# Hinglish
Hinglish font is a font which transliterates unicode devanagari text into Roman English like Hindi speaking people use SMS using English alphabets. Transliteration logic is programmed into the OTF (opentype features file), hence this font can be used in web browsers and word processors to transliterate Hindi to Roman English.

The benefit is that those who can't read devanagari script but can read english alphabets, as is the case with most Indians, can easily read the whole Hindi wikipedia and content. 

The motive behind making this font is to make a not so literate people into highly literate people.
